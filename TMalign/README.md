## TMalign

Compile `TMalign.cpp` with `g++ -static -O3 -ffast-math -lm -o TMalign TMalign.cpp`. The header of the file has been modified since I was not able to compile the defaul one on OSX.

Test if is working by running `./TMalign ../datasets/covering_pdbs/1a07.pdb ../datasets/covering_pdbs/1d1z.pdb`
